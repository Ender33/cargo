# Cargo #

### What's Cargo? ###
Cargo is a language agnostic PHP deployment tool to deploy any web app.

### Why Cargo? ###
I tried many deployment tools and each one had its pros and cons. I could list a few but it is not the goal to criticize them. They inspired this project so I think I should better thank them. :)
But (IMHO) unfortunaly all this project have some the problem: the lack of flexibility.

I work in a web agency, and I have to deploy our clients' projects to their hosting who change everytime with many different constraints each time. So I wish a lot of flexibility from my deployment tool.
I also wanted to contribute to open source community for a long time, so here is my (little) contribution.

That's why I created this project. Feel free to contribute or criticize it, it will be highly appreciated! :)
